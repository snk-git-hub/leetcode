Most problems fall into these categories. Learn to identify them:


| **Pattern** | **Clue Words** | **Common Approach** |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Two Pointers** | Sorted array, pairs, palindrome | Left & right pointers |
| **Sliding Window** | Subarray, substring, consecutive | Expand/contract window |
| **Binary Search** | Sorted, find target, log(n) | Left/right boundaries |
| **Hash Map** | Count, frequency, O(1) lookup | Store seen elements |
| **Stack** | Nested, parentheses, next greater | LIFO structure |
| **Queue/BFS** | Level-order, shortest path | FIFO structure |
| **DFS** | All paths, backtracking | Recursion |
| **DP** | Optimal, maximum, count ways | Subproblems + memoization |
| **Greedy** | Maximize/minimize, local optimal | Make best choice now |
| **Prefix Sum** | Range query, subarray sum | Cumulative sum array |

Here's a proven strategy for when you get stuck on a problem:

## ⏰ Time-Based Approach

### **For Easy Problems:**
- **0-5 min:** Read, understand, try brute force
- **5-10 min:** If stuck, think about common patterns (hash map, two pointers)
- **10-15 min:** Still stuck? → **LOOK AT HINTS** (LeetCode provides hints)
- **15 min:** If no progress → **READ SOLUTION**, understand it, code it yourself

### **For Medium Problems:**
- **0-10 min:** Understand problem, examples, edge cases
- **10-25 min:** Try solving (brute force → optimize)
- **25-35 min:** Stuck? → **READ HINTS** or look at topic tags
- **35-40 min:** Still struggling? → **READ SOLUTION**
- **40+ min:** Understand solution deeply, implement from scratch

### **For Hard Problems:**
- **0-15 min:** Understand thoroughly, think about approach
- **15-40 min:** Attempt solution
- **40-50 min:** If stuck → **HINTS/TAGS**
- **50-60 min:** No progress? → **READ EDITORIAL**

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Problem Solving Framework

### **1. UNDERSTAND (5-10 min)**
```
□ Read problem 2-3 times
□ Identify input/output
□ Work through examples manually
□ Think of edge cases:
  - Empty input
  - Single element
  - All same elements
  - Maximum constraints
  - Negative numbers (if applicable)
□ Can you explain the problem to someone else?
```

### **2. EXPLORE (5-15 min)**
```
□ What's the brute force solution? (Always start here!)
□ What's the time/space complexity?
□ Draw it out on paper
□ Try small examples (n=1, n=2, n=3)
□ Look for patterns
□ Ask yourself:
  - Have I solved something similar?
  - What data structure fits naturally?
  - Is there sorting/searching involved?
  - Can I use hash map for O(1) lookups?
  - Is it about counting/frequency?
  - Does order matter?
```

### **3. PLAN (5-10 min)**
```
□ Choose an approach
□ Write pseudocode
□ Identify data structures needed
□ Think through the algorithm step-by-step
□ Verify with examples
```

### **4. IMPLEMENT (10-20 min)**
```
□ Write clean code
□ Use meaningful variable names
□ Comment complex parts
□ Handle edge cases
```

### **5. TEST (3-5 min)**
```
□ Run provided examples
□ Test edge cases
□ Dry run through your code
□ Check for off-by-one errors
□ Look for array out of bounds
```

## 🚨 When You're STUCK - Decision Tree

### **After trying for [time limit above]:**

**Option A: Use Hints** (Recommended first)
- Read first hint only
- Try for 5 more minutes
- Still stuck? Next hint
- This helps you learn the thought process

**Option B: Check Topic Tags**
- LeetCode shows topics (DP, Binary Search, etc.)
- This narrows down the approach
- Try for 10 more minutes with this knowledge

**Option C: Read Solution** (If Options A & B don't help)
- **DON'T just copy the code!**
- Read the **approach/intuition** section only
- Close the solution
- Try implementing yourself
- Stuck again? Read the code
- **THEN**: Close everything and code from scratch

**Option D: Watch Video Editorial** (If you need more explanation)
- NeetCode, Abdul Bari, or LeetCode's official videos
- Understand WHY this approach works
- Code it yourself after watching

## 📝 After Solving (CRITICAL STEP)

### **Learning Phase (10-15 min):**
```
1. Write down the key insight/pattern
2. What made this problem tricky?
3. What pattern/technique did it use?
4. Add to your notes:
   "Problem X uses [Pattern Y]"
   Example: "Two Sum uses hash map for O(1) lookup"

5. Mark for review:
   - If you got it: Review in 3 days
   - If you looked at hints: Review tomorrow
   - If you read solution: Review TONIGHT (before sleep)
```

## 🎓 Pattern Recognition (THE SECRET SAUCE)


## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Never spend more than 60 min on one problem** during practice
   - You're practicing, not competing
   - Learning the pattern is more valuable than struggling

2. **The 30-minute rule:**
   - If no progress after 30 min → use hints/tags
   - Don't waste time being completely stuck

3. **Implement the brute force FIRST:**
   - Even if it's slow
   - Then optimize
   - This prevents analysis paralysis

4. **Review > Solving new problems:**
   - Solving 1 problem 3 times (spaced out) > solving 3 new problems once
   - Repetition builds pattern recognition

5. **Keep a "Stuck Log":**
   ```
   Problem: Two Sum
   Got stuck at: Optimizing from O(n²)
   Solution: Hash map for O(1) lookup
   Pattern: Space-time tradeoff
   ```

6. **During contests:**
   - If stuck on Q2 for 20+ min → move to Q3
   - Come back later with fresh eyes
   - Don't waste time on one problem

## 📊 Example: You're Stuck on "Container With Most Water"

**0-5 min:** Read problem, understand examples
```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49 (between 8 and 7)
```

**5-15 min:** Try brute force
```cpp
// Check all pairs - O(n²)
int maxArea = 0;
for i in 0 to n:
  for j in i+1 to n:
    area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j-i)
    maxArea = max(maxArea, area)
```

**15-20 min:** This works but can we optimize?
- **STUCK!** Can't think of better approach

**20 min:** Check **HINT 1**
- "The widest container uses the outermost lines..."
- **Aha!** Start from both ends?

**25 min:** Try implementing two pointers
```cpp
left = 0, right = n-1
while left < right:
  area = min(height[left], height[right]) * (right-left)
  if height[left] < height[right]:
    left++
  else:
    right--
```

**30 min:** Got it! Pattern learned: **Two pointers for optimization**

## ✅ Your Action Plan

### **Today:**
1. Pick 2-3 Easy problems
2. Use this framework
3. Time yourself strictly
4. Write down patterns you discover

### **This Week:**
1. Practice this framework on 10-15 problems
2. Build your pattern recognition
3. Create a "Pattern Cheat Sheet"
4. Review problems you solved 3 days ago

**Remember:** Getting stuck is NORMAL. The goal is to learn the pattern, not to solve every problem independently. Even top competitive programmers look up solutions when learning!
